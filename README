This is an event driven http-server. which has two events: a write and read event. 
Sockets can have two states, reading or writing. During a poll, if a socket needs to be read, a read event is created. The read event will read as much as it can from the socket into a buffer.
If the buffer doesn't contain a proper html header, we didn't read enough so generate another read event.
Else if we have what we need in the buffer, go ahead and parse the header and do whatever needs to be done (serve a file, do a systemtask, error, etc). Once it is done processing, it creates a write event. Polling will start a write event when a socket is able to be written. A write event writes as much of it's buffer as it can to a socket. If it finishes, either end the connection or keep it alive by adding a read event.
